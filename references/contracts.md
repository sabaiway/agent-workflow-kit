# Setup contracts

The three choices the bootstrap makes with the user — **visibility**, **conversational
language**, and **agent attribution** — each have a contract below. `SKILL.md` links here so the
main procedure stays lean; load this file when you need the full rule for a contract (e.g. while
filling the matching `AGENTS.md` block, or when an `upgrade` migration touches it).

Ask each as a **structured multiple-choice prompt where your agent supports it** (`AskUserQuestion`
in Claude Code), otherwise in prose — and always wait for the answer before writing.

## Visibility contract

The user chooses at bootstrap whether the AI artifacts are visible in the repo or hidden — an
**explicit up-front question** (bootstrap step 2), never an assumed default. The two modes then
diverge:

- **visible** — artifacts are committed. Wire the project's `package.json` scripts (`docs:check` / `docs:index` / `docs:index:check` / `docs:archive` / `docs:archive:check` / `docs:archive:issues` / `docs:archive:issues:check` / `prepare: node scripts/install-git-hooks.mjs`) and add a minimal `.gitignore` (`docs/plans/`, `.claude/settings.local.json`). This is the canonical model.
- **hidden** (in-tree) — same files on disk, but the repo "looks normal": append the artifact paths (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ai/`, `docs/plans/`, `scripts/*.mjs` you added, `docs/ai/.workflow-version`) to the global excludes file git **already uses** (`git config --get core.excludesFile`); if none is set, point it at `~/.gitignore_global` (`git config --global core.excludesFile ~/.gitignore_global`) and append there. **Verify `git status` shows the artifacts as ignored** afterwards. **Do not edit `package.json`** — that is a tracked change and would leak; the pre-commit hook (always untracked in `.git/hooks/`) calls the scripts via `node scripts/<x>.mjs` directly.

Not in this version: a fully-external hidden mode (artifacts relocated outside the repo tree).
Deferred to a later release + migration.

## Communication contract

The user chooses at bootstrap (step 3) which language the agent **talks to them** in. The choice is
recorded in the *Communication language* block of the project's `AGENTS.md`, so every agent that
reads the entry point honours it — and stops drifting between languages mid-session.

Scope — **dialogue only**:

- **In the chosen language** — everything the agent produces *for the user to read*: questions, explanations, plan summaries, status updates, commit-message prose if asked, review notes.
- **Always in their source language (usually English)** — code, identifiers, file paths, shell commands, log/console output, error strings, config keys, and abbreviations/acronyms. Translating these breaks copy-paste, search, and tooling.
- **Files stay English** — the deployed `docs/ai/` files, `AGENTS.md`, and this kernel are English-only regardless of the chosen language (cross-agent / cross-team portability). The conversational language is about the *chat*, not the *artifacts*.

Default to the language the user is already writing in; confirm rather than assume. On `upgrade`, a
pre-1.1.0 deployment with no block gets one (the agent asks).

---

## Attribution contract

The user chooses at bootstrap (step 4) whether the agent may **attribute work to itself or to AI**.
The choice is recorded in the *Attribution* block of the project's `AGENTS.md`, so every agent that
reads the entry point honours it. **Default is `off`** — people are routinely surprised to find an
AI listed as a repo contributor (a `Co-Authored-By` trailer is enough to do it), so opt-in, never
opt-out.

When attribution is **`off`**, no mention of the agent, AI, or the model appears **anywhere**:

- **No `Co-Authored-By` trailers** and **no "Generated with …" footers** on commits or PRs.
- **No AI/agent/model references** in code, comments, commit messages, PR titles/bodies, branch names, or `docs/` prose. The work reads as the human author's.
- **Two enforcement layers** — the *Attribution* block binds everything an agent writes **by hand**; the automatic `Co-Authored-By` trailer is added by the **harness**, not the prose, so for **Claude Code** the kit also sets `"includeCoAuthoredBy": false` in the project's `.claude/settings.json`. Other tools: disable their equivalent co-author/footer setting if present.

When **`on`**, the agent may add its standard trailer / footer per the user's tooling defaults. This
block is about *attribution*, not authorship of the actual changes — quality, tests, and the "ask
before commit" rule are unchanged either way.

On `upgrade`, a pre-1.2.0 deployment with no block gets one (the agent asks, defaulting to `off`).
