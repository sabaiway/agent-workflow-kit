# Install agent-workflow-kit launchers for whichever non-Claude agents you have.
# Claude Code needs no launcher — it reads the kit natively from ~/.claude/skills/.

# SAFE BY DEFAULT — additive only:
#   - Writes only the kit's OWN namespaced slots:
#       ~/.codex/skills/agent-workflow-kit                     (a symlink)
#       ~/.codeium/.../global_workflows/agent-workflow-kit.md  (a managed file)
#   - NEVER touches your other Codex skills or Windsurf workflows.
#   - If one of those exact slots already holds a file the kit did NOT write, it is
#     left untouched and you are told. Re-run with --force to replace it; --force first
#     backs the file up (.bak.<timestamp>) and prints the command to restore it.
